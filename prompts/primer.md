# The Project Primer

Today we are going to be working on a Node NPM package called `vercel-doorman` written in Typescript that is designed to help users protect their web applications from malicious requests through our bouncer middleware and CLI tool for managing Vercel Firewall rules in code.
 
## Our Goal Today

Initially this project will provide a ready-to-rock middleware for Next.js applications with a simple composable API. It is designed to allow users to easily add middleware redirects to their Next.js applications for common malicious requests.

Docs page from Next.js on Middleware: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#example

We are going to be building out this middleware in the `/workspace/src/next/middleware` directory.

If you have any questions about the project or the underlying depedencies, please let me know.

## Rules

When we are working together you must follow the rules below:

- do not attempt to install any packages or run any commands.  
- I will run tests, install additional dependencies and handle running the site on my local machine.
- Your role is strictly to help me upgrade this project and add some new functionality.


Does that all make sense?
